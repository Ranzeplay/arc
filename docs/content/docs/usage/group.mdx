title: Group
---

A group is a way to combine many data and multiple functions.

## Syntax

```
<accessibility> group <name>
{
    <members>
}
```

## Example

```
public group Bar
{
      @Getter
      public field var bitem: val int;

      public func getFoo(var self: ref Bar, var addend: val int): val Foo
      {
         var foo: val Foo;
         foo.fitem = self.bitem + addend;

         return foo;
      }
}
```

## Members

### Field

The syntax of defining a field is similar to declaring data in a function.

```
<accessibility> field <mutability> <name>: <memory storage> <type>;
```

#### Annotations

##### Getter

Automatically generate a getter function.

##### Setter

Automatically generate the assignment function.

##### Accessor

Do the work of `Getter` and `Setter`.

### Function

The syntax of defining a function is the same as defining an individual function, and it behaves just like an individual function.

### Method

The syntax of defining a function is similar to defining an individual function, however, its first parameter should be a reference of current `Group` type and be a reference.

## Annotations

#### WithAnnotation

The group can be used as an annotation.

#### NoType

The group will not be used as a type, so it cannot have any methods at the same time.
