title: Declare data
---

## Syntax

```
<mutability> <name>: <memory storage> <type>;
```

## Example

To create a variable `foo` with an integer value,

```
var foo: val int;
```

To create a constant `bar` with an string reference.

```
const bar: ref string;
```

## Variable vs. constant

### Variable

You can reassign the value to the variable and change its inner value for multiple times.

### Constant

You cannot reassign the value to the constant or change its inner value once it is initialized or assigned.

## Value vs. reference

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_type_and_reference_type)

The language will ensure the ownership of all data, manipulaing and managing them in a safe manner.
