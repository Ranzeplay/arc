# Arc Programming Language Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the Arc programming language, including key milestones, features, and timeline estimates.

## Phase 1: Foundation (1-3 months)
- [ ] Define core language syntax and semantics
- [ ] Implement lexer and parser
- [ ] Create basic AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) representation
- [ ] Develop simple interpreter for MVP functionality
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for testing
- [ ] Write initial language specification document

## Phase 2: Core Features (3-6 months)
- [ ] Type system implementation
  - [ ] Primitive types
  - [ ] User-defined types
  - [ ] Type inference
- [ ] Memory management system
- [ ] Basic standard library
  - [ ] I/O operations
  - [ ] Data structures
  - [ ] String manipulation
- [ ] Error handling mechanism
- [ ] Module/package system

## Phase 3: Compiler Development (6-9 months)
- [ ] Implement code generation backend
  - [ ] IR (Intermediate Representation)
  - [ ] Optimization passes
- [ ] Target platform compilation (initially x86_64)
- [ ] Implement basic optimizations
- [ ] Create toolchain (compiler, linker, etc.)

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (9-12 months)
- [ ] Concurrency model
- [ ] Advanced type system features
  - [ ] Generics
  - [ ] Traits/interfaces
- [ ] Standard library expansion
- [ ] Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
- [ ] Debug tooling
- [ ] REPL environment

## Phase 5: Ecosystem Building (12+ months)
- [ ] Package manager
- [ ] IDE integration
  - [ ] Syntax highlighting
  - [ ] Code completion
  - [ ] Debugging support
- [ ] Documentation generation tools
- [ ] Community building
  - [ ] Website and documentation
  - [ ] Example projects
  - [ ] Tutorials and guides

## Long-term Goals
- Cross-platform support
- Self-hosting compiler
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Domain-specific features for target use cases
